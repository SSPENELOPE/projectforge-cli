# Getting Started with my own Create-React-App

- This is the new improved version from my own cli
- Here you will have most of the libraries you need pre-installed and ready to get hacking.
- The Navbar and footer are already build using react-bootstrap and MDBBootstrap
- run the `npm start` command and go checkout your new create react app template
