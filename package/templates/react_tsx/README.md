# New and Improved Create React App with TypeScript

## What is this?
Welcome to your new and improved create react app. This app is the modernized version of create react app. It includes the following features:
1. **Hot Reloading**: Make changes to your code and see them instantly reflected in the browser without having to manually refresh the page.
2. **ES6+ Support**: Write your code using the latest JavaScript features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring assignments.
3. **CSS Modules**: Use CSS Modules to encapsulate styles and prevent class name collisions.
4. **Code Splitting**: Optimize your app's performance by splitting your code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
5. **Routing**: Implement client-side routing with ease using popular libraries like React Router.
6. **State Management**: Manage your app's state efficiently with libraries like Redux or MobX.
7. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your components using testing frameworks like Jest or React Testing Library.
8. **Linting and Formatting**: Ensure code quality and consistency with tools like ESLint and Prettier.
9. **Production Build**: Generate optimized and minified bundles for deployment to production environments.

## Pages

### Home Page
- This page is a boiler plate that leverages the Navbar and Footer component, customize them as needed

### Login Page
- This page contains a React Bootstrap form that takes in a username or email and a users password
- You can update this as need but you should have most of the tools you need to easily set this up package and send your data to an endpoint 

### Signup Page
- The signup page contains a React Bootstrap form ready to take in a bunch of user parameters. It is already prepped and stored in a state variable that is updated through a handler function. The submit function is ready for you to package up your data and send it to an endpoint

## Components

### Navbar
- The navbar is built using React Bootstrap, edit and change it as needed. 
- The links are all dummy links so you will need to update those all except for the home link

### Footer
- The footer is built using MDB, feel free to update or scrap it. Use at your projects needs

## Classes
- Included in the utils folder is the AuthService class. This class is set up and primed for you to send of your login and signup data to your desired endpoint. Other authentication logic can be added here.

Feel free to explore the codebase and customize it to fit your needs. Happy coding!
