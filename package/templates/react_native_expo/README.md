# React_Native Expo

## What is in this?
- As of right now this is just a boilerplate react native expo mobile app. I have lost of plans for future development to ensure that this mobile app comes pre packaged with all the modern features a mobile app should include which has a login/signup page with a more advanced navigation section at the bottom of the app.

- Stay tuned on NPM to watch for more updates to this
